**Rule:** if a file in this index already exists, **read it; do not recreate it**.
If you believe an existing file is wrong, propose an edit — never shadow it
with a new file at a different path.

## ⚡ Hard rules (read AGENTS.md for the long form)

1. **Never `git commit` / `git push`.** Append a tracking row via
   [`xops/agent/tracking_append.sh`](../xops/agent/tracking_append.sh),
   then `git add -A`, then stop. Human runs `make git`.
2. **Tests move with code** in the same commit.
3. **No system-level changes** without explicit per-occurrence confirmation.
4. **Non-zero exit recovery:** wrap risky commands with
   [`xops/agent/safe-run.sh`](../xops/agent/safe-run.sh); read the log,
   diagnose, fix, resume. Never retry blindly.
5. **Session recovery:** run [`xops/agent/session-bootstrap.sh`](../xops/agent/session-bootstrap.sh)
   at session start; surface any unresolved `last_failure.json`.
6. **Phase persistence:** when asked to implement a phase / sub-phase, drain every
   `[ ]` bullet before handing back. See
   [`.agents/skills/phase-persistence/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/phase-persistence/SKILL.md).

## 🤖 Custom agents

| Agent | When | File |
|---|---|---|
| `planner` | Decomposing a request into a roadmap or implementation plan | [`agents/planner.agent.md`](agents/planner.agent.md) |
| `implementer` | Executing a plan / phase end-to-end with tracking + staging | [`agents/implementer.agent.md`](agents/implementer.agent.md) |
| `reviewer` | Reviewing a phase's staged diff (middle stage of the per-phase gate) | [`agents/reviewer.agent.md`](agents/reviewer.agent.md) |
| `verifier` | Final mechanical gate per phase: verification checks + invariant checks | [`agents/verifier.agent.md`](agents/verifier.agent.md) |

Each `/implement` phase runs the **`implementer → reviewer → verifier`** gate
before the next phase starts — no exceptions.

## ⚡ Slash commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/plan` | Produce a written plan (no code) for a request. |
| `/implement` | Execute a plan / phase end-to-end, ending in `staged` / `reverted` / `no-op` / `blocked`. |
| `/review` | Self-review or peer-review staged or recent changes against AGENTS.md rules. |
| `/verify` | Run the mechanical verification gate and return PASS / FAIL. |
| `/track` | Append a tracking row (used implicitly by `/implement`). |
| `/roadmap-status` | Summarize ROADMAP checkbox progress. |

## 🧠 Load skills on demand

[`.agents/skills/`](../.agents/skills/) contains short, model-agnostic skill files.
Load the relevant one before the matching kind of work. Especially:

- [`test-driven-development`](../.agents/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md)
- [`systematic-debugging`](../.agents/skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md)
- [`verification-before-completion`](../.agents/skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md)
- [`self-review`](../.agents/skills/self-review/SKILL.md)
- [`phase-persistence`](../.agents/skills/phase-persistence/SKILL.md)
- [`parallel-subagents`](../.agents/skills/parallel-subagents/SKILL.md)
- [`codegraph-management`](../.agents/skills/codegraph-management/SKILL.md) — and follow the CodeGraph-first rule in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) §9.

## 💬 Communication discipline

- One short status line per loop step.
- File paths as workspace-relative markdown links.
- After staging: report `run_id`, files staged, tests run / passed / failed. Four lines max.
- After a revert: report `run_id`, which gate failed, the corrective action.

## 🧠 Memory & notes

If you keep long-lived per-repo notes, store them under `docs/tracking/state/notes/`
(gitignored). The memory tool, when available, may keep its own scope under
`/memories/repo/` — do not duplicate large facts already in this file.
